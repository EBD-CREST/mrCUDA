** Development prior to rCUDA 3 by apenya **

23-May-11: v2.0.3a
	- Partially fixed Malloc3D bugs. It still needs further review for some cases.

26-Jan-11: v2.0.2
	- Fixed stream order
	- Improved "cudaLaunch" call by buffering "preCudaLaunch" results

19-Jan-11: v2.0.1
	- Fix: included "sys/stat.h" header file preventing compilation rCUDAl.cpp on some systems
	- Fixed "make install" script on rCUDAl

19-Nov-10: v2.0
        - Updated API to 3.1
	- Server now uses Runtime API when possible (CUDA >= 3.1 required).
        - Introduced support for the most common CUBLAS routines.
	- Fixed some bugs.
	- Updated paper reference suggestions.
	- Added AF_UNIX sockets support to enhance performance on local executions (-l).
	- Added some load balancing capabilities to the server (-b).
	- General performance improvements.
	- Officially added Fermi support.
	- Added restriction: client and server must both feature 32 or 64 bit architectures

02-Jun-10: v1.0.3
	- Introduced additional error checks in "cudaMemcpy" (server side).
	- Fixed Volkov's sgemm example to use randomly generated data.

24-May-10: v1.0.2
	- Added support to change GPU server on the fly (setenv + cudaThreadExit): the TCP
          connection is now reset by cudaThreadExit and the RCUDA environment variable is
          re-read before attempting a new connection.
	- Fixed: the rCUDA library now issues a warning if the repository directory is not
          found.
	- Added Volkov's sgemm example.
	- Added libcudart.so symbolic link in rCUDAl Makefile.

22-Apr-10: v1.0.1
	- Fixed: cudaThreadExit hangs in some situations. Also made improvements to avoid
          resending the GPU image.
	- Introduced TIMEIT mode: if compiled with -DTIMEIT, client and server track their
          respective time spent on sending data through the network.
	- Updated VHPC paper reference.

01-Apr-10: v1.0
	- Initial release.
